# Concept-graph correctness review (Tier-1 structural validation)

> **Date:** 2026-06-20. **Method:** multi-agent adversarial audit — 12 topic
> groups × 2 lenses (mathematical correctness; dependency faithfulness) = 24
> auditors, each finding re-checked by an independent skeptical verifier (58
> agents total). **Result:** 34 findings surfaced → **16 confirmed, 13 arguable**.
> This is the OVERNIGHT_PLAN Phase 3 artifact and the ADR-0004 §9 Tier-1 record:
> it documents what the audit found, what was changed, what was deliberately left,
> and lists every prerequisite edge + its justification for human sign-off.

## Fixes applied (confirmed findings + clear arguable improvements)

| # | Target | Change |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `object` | Removed the bogus `symbol` prerequisite (a `primitive` must have none — now validator-enforced); the symbol/object relation is recast as a **symmetric `contrasts`** (mark vs. thing). |
| 2 | `bound-variable` ↔ `free-variable` | Added the missing symmetric `contrasts` (exact logical complements). |
| 3 | `proof-tree` ↔ `proof-dag` | Added the missing symmetric `contrasts` (each defined against the other). |
| 4 | `theorem` | Added `formal-theory` prerequisite — "a sentence provable **from a theory** T" was undeclared. |
| 5 | `satisfaction` | **Math fix:** reworded to be assignment-correct — an open formula is satisfied under a variable assignment; a `sentence` (added as prerequisite) gives plain truth in M. The old "makes the formula true" was undefined for open formulas. |
| 6 | `metatheory` | Example now uses `$G_{\mathrm{PA}}$`, not bare `$G$` (notation discipline). |
| 7 | `effectively-axiomatized` | **Math fix:** definition is now "axiom set is **recursively enumerable** (decidable for concrete systems like PA)", not "a decidable axiom set" — the standard hypothesis is r.e. (Craig's theorem). Added `recursively-enumerable` prerequisite. |
| 8 | `recursively-enumerable` | Dropped the `provability` prerequisite (it was an *example*, not a dependency); reworded to separate the enumerator and semi-decider characterizations. |
| 9 | `primitive-recursive` | Dropped the `proof` prerequisite (an example, not a dependency); demoted the `@c{proof}` chip to plain text. |
| 10 | `godel-coding` | Trimmed the definition to just the numbering; "syntactic *relations* become arithmetic" now belongs to `arithmetization`. |
| 11 | `representable` | **Math fix:** reworded to the proof-theoretic property (T ⊢ φ of the right tuples, T ⊢ ¬φ of the rest) — "holds of the right numbers" read as truth-in-ℕ, the exact ⊢/⊨ category error the site guards. |
| 12 | `proof-predicate` | Dropped the transitively-redundant direct `arithmetization` edge (reachable via `representable`). |
| 13 | `first-incompleteness` | **Math fix (2026-06-21):** *truth* of G_T needs only **consistency**, not soundness (biconditional holds in ℕ via the base arithmetic; counterexample PA+¬Con(PA)). Edges: dropped `soundness`; added `omega-consistency`, `rosser-sentence` (irrefutability) and `satisfaction` (the ℕ⊨G_T truth clause). Per CONTENT_NOTES §1. |
| 14 | `godel-sentence` | **Math fix (2026-06-21):** example now states ℕ ⊨ G_PA follows from PA's *consistency* (no soundness hedge). Per CONTENT_NOTES §1. |
| 15 | `formation-rule` | Definition now covers base clauses ("$0$ is a term"), not only inductive steps. |
| 16 | `object-theory` | Replaced the bare "not about itself" with a coding-aware framing (arithmetic can encode claims about the theory — the Stage 12–14 payoff). |

**Validator hardening:** a concept flagged `primitive` must now have empty
`prerequisites` (the contradiction in finding #1 was previously uncaught).

## Deferred (arguable findings left as-is, with rationale)

- **`term` "names an object" with open-term example** — kept; a defensible
  syntax-layer category statement (terms are the number-denoting category).
- **`term` ↔ `atomic-formula` contrast** — not added; that is a *prerequisite*
  (build-on) relation, not a peer "defined-against" contrast; adding it would blur
  the prerequisite/contrast line the model deliberately separates.
- **`free-variable` quiz says "sentence"** — kept; informal, both stage-1.
- **`parser` → `well-formed` redundant** — kept; intentional convention (a direct
  edge mirrors the `@c{}` usage in the node's text; `transitiveReduction` cleans
  the display map).
- **`proof` → `axiom`/`inference-rule` bypassing `formal-theory`** — kept; a
  defensible decomposition; closure is satisfied (proof's text chips axiom/rule).
- **`numeral` ↔ `object` contrast** — not added; the use/mention point is already
  carried by numeral's example and the `object` node.
- **`soundness` → `consistency` justification** — kept; soundness is framed *by
  contrast with* consistency ("implies it but is strictly stronger"), a defensible
  comprehension dependency.
- **`representable` → `primitive-recursive`** — kept; CONTENT_NOTES §6 enshrines
  the prim-rec → representable chain; the `formula` dependency is transitive.
- **`omega-consistency` missing `numeral`** — kept; numeral is available from
  stage-5 and the instances φ(0), φ(1), … are written as plain math.
